### for Multiplica

 **Introduction.**

  This application is made with gatsby, it makes the best use of this technology to be fast and efficient for all members of a team. It simply takes data from an API, shows it on two different pages from which you can copy the data with a simple click. 

  **Framework used**

  I used Gatsby that is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

  Also deployed on Netlify. 

  **How to use it after a fork or a download?**

  It's really simple, from the terminal install the gatsby CLI **`npm install -g gatsby-cli`** then run the command **`gatsby develop`** and on a browser go to localhost:8000 (is the default port for a gatsby project).
